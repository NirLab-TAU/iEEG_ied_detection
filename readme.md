# Automated IED Detection in iEEG Data

This repository contains the code and data pipeline used for the study titled **"Annotated intracranial EEG sleep data aids machine learning in detecting interictal epileptiform discharges"**. The work focuses on the development of a novel dataset and machine learning model for detecting interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) in epilepsy patients during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep.


### Dependencies
- The code was written using conda environment of Python 3.11
- Required Python packages (listed in `requirements.txt`)

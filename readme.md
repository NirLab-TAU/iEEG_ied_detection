# Automated IED Detection in iEEG Data

This repository contains the code and data pipeline used for the study titled **"Automated Detection of Interictal Epileptiform Discharges in Intracranial EEG Data"**. The work focuses on the development of a novel dataset and machine learning model for detecting interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) in epilepsy patients during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep.


### Dependencies
